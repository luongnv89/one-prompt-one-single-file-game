## 🌟 What is AI One-File Arcade?

AI One-File Arcade is an open-source, security-first showcase of AI-generated, single-HTML-file web games. It provides a transparent, educational, and contributor-friendly platform where all games are created by AI models using a single prompt, stored in a structured format, and displayed through a safe sandboxed interface.

Visit the in-app [About page](http://localhost:5173/about) to learn more about the mission, security guarantees, and roadmap.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Generated Only**: Every game is created by AI models (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.)
- 📚 **Educational**: Full transparency with AI prompts included for every game
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Clean, minimalist design with smooth interactions
- 🔍 **Search & Filter**: Find games by name, description, model, or tags
- 📱 **Responsive**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile
- 🚀 **Fast**: Built with Vite for lightning-fast performance
- ✅ **Validated**: Automated security and schema validation for all submissions

   - Edit `games/my-awesome-game/info.json` with metadata
   - Edit `games/my-awesome-game/prompt.md` with your AI prompt

4. **Validate your game**

   ```bash
   npm run validate:games
   ```

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Push to your fork
   - Open a PR with your game
   - CI will automatically validate your submission

## 🔒 Security

We take security seriously. All games are validated for:

- ❌ **Prohibited**: POST requests, WebSockets, EventSource, tracking, analytics
- ✅ **Allowed**: Canvas, WebGL, keyboard/mouse input, approved CDNs only
- 🔐 **Isolation**: Games run in sandboxed iframes with no access to parent origin

The validation script automatically checks for security violations and will reject PRs that don't comply.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please read:
