## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the principles of openness, transparency, and respect. Please be professional and constructive in all interactions.

## What We're Looking For

We welcome AI-generated single-file HTML games that:

- ✅ Are entirely generated by AI models (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.)
- ✅ Run in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- ✅ Demonstrate creativity and fun gameplay
- ✅ Are educational and transparent about their AI origin
- ✅ Follow all security and technical requirements

## Game Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **Single File Format**: All game code must be in one `index.html` file
2. **AI-Generated**: Must be created by an AI model from a prompt (not hand-written)
3. **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies (except approved CDNs - see Security Rules)
4. **Playable**: Must be a complete, functional game
5. **Transparent**: Include the prompt used to generate the game

### Required Files

Every game submission must include:

```
/games/[your-game-slug]/
├── index.html      # The game file (required)
├── info.json       # Game metadata (required)
└── prompt.md       # AI prompt used (required)
```

### info.json Schema

```json
{
  "name": "Your Game Title",
  "description": "A brief description of your game (1-2 sentences)",
  "model": "GPT-4o",

  "controls": {
    "type": "mouse",
    "instructions": "Brief description of how to control the game"

- `tags`: Array of relevant tags
- `genre`: Game genre (Arcade, Puzzle, Action, etc.)
- `difficulty`: Easy, Medium, Hard
- `controls`: Control scheme description
- `duration`: Expected play time
- `dateAdded`: Submission date

### prompt.md Format

Your `prompt.md` must include:

1. **The Exact Prompt**: Copy-paste the exact text you sent to the AI
2. **AI Model Output**: Brief description of what was generated
3. **Modifications**: Any changes you made to the AI's output
4. **Security Notes**: Confirm compliance with security rules

## Security Rules

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Games will be rejected if they violate these rules.

### Prohibited

- ❌ POST requests (`fetch(method: 'POST')`, `XMLHttpRequest POST`, etc.)
- ❌ WebSockets
- ❌ EventSource
- ❌ Analytics or tracking code
- ❌ External images or assets (except approved CDNs)
- ❌ Local storage or cookie-based tracking
- ❌ File system access
- ❌ Network requests to non-approved domains

### Allowed

- ✅ Canvas and WebGL for graphics
- ✅ Keyboard and mouse input
- ✅ Local game state (variables, objects)
- ✅ requestAnimationFrame for game loops
- ✅ Audio (using Web Audio API or HTML5 audio)
- ✅ LocalStorage for game progress (non-tracking)
- ✅ Approved CDNs:
  - jsdelivr.net
  - unpkg.com
  - cdnjs.cloudflare.com
  - fonts.googleapis.com
  - fonts.gstatic.com

### CDN Usage Example

If you need a library, use approved CDNs:

```html
<!-- Good: Using jsdelivr -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.70.0/dist/phaser.min.js"></script>

<!-- Bad: Using unapproved CDN -->
<script src="https://example-cdn.com/library.js"></script>
```

## How to Submit a Game

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Click the "Fork" button on the repository page.

### Step 2: Create a Game Folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/one-prompt-one-single-file-game.git
cd one-prompt-one-single-file-game
git checkout -b add-my-awesome-game
```

### Step 3: Use the Template

Copy the template files:

```bash
cp -r templates/game games/my-awesome-game
```

### Step 4: Add Your Game

1. Edit `games/my-awesome-game/index.html` with your AI-generated game
2. Edit `games/my-awesome-game/info.json` with your game metadata
3. Edit `games/my-awesome-game/prompt.md` with your AI prompt

### Step 5: Validate Your Game

Run the validation script:

```bash
npm run validate:games
```

Or test manually:

1. Open `games/my-awesome-game/index.html` in a browser
2. Verify the game works correctly
3. Check that info.json is valid JSON
4. Ensure prompt.md contains your AI prompt

### Step 6: Commit and Push

```bash
git add games/my-awesome-game
git commit -m "Add: My Awesome Game - A fun AI-generated arcade game"
git push origin add-my-awesome-game
```

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "Pull Request"
3. Fill out the PR template
4. Submit the PR

## Validation

### Automatic Validation

Our CI pipeline automatically validates:

- ✅ info.json schema compliance
- ✅ HTML file exists and is valid
- ✅ Security rule violations (POST, WebSockets, etc.)
- ✅ Forbidden CDN usage
- ✅ Code formatting and linting

### Manual Validation

Before submitting, verify:

1. **Game Works**: Open index.html in a browser
2. **JSON Valid**: Validate info.json with a JSON linter
3. **Prompt Included**: Ensure prompt.md contains the full AI prompt
4. **No Security Violations**: Review the Security Rules section
5. **Build Passes**: Run `npm run build` successfully

### Common Rejection Reasons

- ❌ Missing or invalid info.json
- ❌ No prompt.md or incomplete prompt
- ❌ POST requests detected
- ❌ Unapproved CDN usage
- ❌ Game doesn't load or play
- ❌ Non-AI-generated content
- ❌ Multiple HTML files

## Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: Your PR must pass all CI checks
2. **Maintainer Review**: A maintainer will review within 48 hours
3. **Testing**: The game will be tested in the arcade
4. **Approval**: If approved, your game will be merged and deployed
5. **Rejection**: If rejected, you'll receive feedback on what to fix

## Tips for Success

### Writing Effective Prompts

Be specific and detailed in your AI prompts:

```
✅ Good Prompt:
Create a simple snake game with the following features:
- 400x400 canvas with a black background
- Snake starts at center with 3 segments
- Arrow keys control snake direction
- Food appears randomly on canvas
- Snake grows when eating food
- Game over if snake hits walls or itself
- Score display at the top
- Restart button when game ends
- Use only vanilla JavaScript, no external libraries

❌ Bad Prompt:
Make a snake game
```

### Game Ideas

Need inspiration? Try these genres:

- **Arcade**: Simple clickers, reaction games
- **Puzzle**: Match-3, logic puzzles
- **Action**: Simple platformers, dodgers
- **Classic**: Pong, Tetris, Snake

### Testing Your Game

Test thoroughly:

- Different screen sizes
- Keyboard controls
- Mouse controls
- Game over and restart
- Edge cases

### Performance Tips

- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation
- Avoid excessive DOM manipulation
- Keep code clean and readable
- Comment complex sections
